# holochain-nodejs

Nodejs Holochain Container primarily for the execution of tests

## Installation

The recommended way to install is via npm https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/holochain-nodejs.

## Usage
After installing via npm the module can be used in a node script as follows:
```javascript
const Container = require('@holochain/holochain-nodejs');
const app = Container.instanceFromNameAndDna("bob", "dist/app_spec.hcpkg");
app.start();

// make calls to the app instance
// zome functions can be called using
// app.call(zome, capability, function, params);

app.stop();
```

Note about usage:
prior to version 0.2.0, you could only instantiate one instance of an app.
What it looked like:
```
const app = Container.loadAndInstantiate("dist/app_spec.hcpkg");
```

Now in version 0.2.0, you can instantiate more than one, and they can communicate, making what we call "scenario testing" possible.
This also means that you need to uniquely identify the two, by providing each a unique agent id.
So the function name changed from `loadAndInstantiate` to `instanceFromNameAndDna`.
You can use it like this:
```
const app = Container.instanceFromNameAndDna("bob", "dist/app_spec.hcpkg");
const app2 = Container.instanceFromNameAndDna("alice", "dist/app_spec.hcpkg");
```
